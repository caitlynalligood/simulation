About the Project:
This python code simulates the environmental impact of tourists on a trail over a period of one year.
It models the accumulation of litter, the effects of clean-up operations, and the degradation and maintenance of trail quality.
It models:
-Litter accumulations generated by tourist
-Effects of increased clean up
-The degradation of trail quality due to erosion
-improvement  of trail quality by increases maintenance

Built With:
Numpy- used for numerical operations and random number generation
Pandas- used for data manipulation and saving results to csv file
Logging- used to log simulation events


Parameters:
The code uses the following parameters to run the simulation:
days: Number of days to simulate (default: 365)
daily_tourists_mean: Average number of tourists per day (default: 11000)
daily_tourists_std: Standard deviation for the number of tourists (default: 1000)
litter_per_tourist: Average litter generated per tourist in kg (default: 0.2)
clean_up_frequency: Frequency of clean-up operations in days (default: 1)
clean_up_efficiency: Efficiency of clean-up operations (default: 0.9)
erosion_rate: Rate of trail erosion per tourist (default: 0.0001)
trail_maintenance_frequency: Frequency of trail maintenance in days (default: 7)
trail_maintenance_improvement: Improvement in trail quality after maintenance (default: 10)

Output
The code generates two output files:
Simulation.log: a file containing detailed information about each day's simulations
Simulation_data.csv: A CSV file containing the daily data for tourist, total litter and trail quality

Usage
Clone the repository or download the script.
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed.
Run the script using Python

Logging
The script uses Python's logging module to log detailed information about the simulation process.
The logs are saved to simulation.log and include timestamps for each event.

Goals
This is the initial version of the code but it will be updated to add visualizations, including
graphs and a data analyzer for trend analysis and scenario comparison.
